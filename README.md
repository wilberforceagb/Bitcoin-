        <h1>Bitcoin (BTC)</h1>
        <p>Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that enables peer-to-peer transactions over the internet without the need for a central authority.</p>
        <p>It was created in 2009 by an anonymous person or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>
        <p>Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain, ensuring transparency and security.</p>
        <p>The limited supply of 21 million bitcoins makes it a deflationary asset, often compared to digital gold.</p>
